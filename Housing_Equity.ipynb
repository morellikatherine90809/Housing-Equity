    "Determine significance between proportions of housed clients. Used SQL to determine total number of clients in from each region and number of clients in from each region that were housed. Region 1: 328 total clients and 252 housed clients, proportion of 0.768 region 1 clients were housed. Region 2: 58 total clients and 33 housed clients, proportion of 0.569 region 2 clients were housed. z-test selected to compare proportions because the total clients from each region are very different from each other and each total is quite small. a = 0.05, p-value less than 0.05 shows a significant difference in the proportion of housed clients from each region, indicating inequitable housing outcomes."
